                Hello! My name is John Doe, and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. 
                My interest in technology started back in 2010 when I decided to try customizing WordPress themes â€” turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!
              </p>
              <p>
                Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at a technology consultancy, a start-up, and a large corporation. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences for various clients.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I'm not at the computer, I'm usually rock climbing, playing basketball, or exploring new coffee shops in the city.
              </p>
